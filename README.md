# pwa-spa-main
This is the primary application of the Progressive Web App application. This component is an Angular Architects Webpack Federation Shell Application and this shell component serves Vue.js, React and Angular micro-frontends. While the work on this application is unlicensed and I happily want you to use it in any capacity -- I encourage you to do your own due diligence in inspecting licensing & terms of the various lower level modules, componentry & packages enabling this applications.

# Installation
I set up bin/local-deploy.sh to deploy the application to my local machine. You may need to adjust the script to your own environment.

In the same folder, build.sh simply installs dependencies and builds the application.

# CICD
I have an example pipeline available in the .github folder. Adjust the pipeline to your own environment.
